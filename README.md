WHMCS Order Form Bootstrap Template
=============

Order form template for use with the WHMCS billing software.



Requirements
-----------

This template was designed to run along side our bootstrap client area template.



Features
-----------

* HTML is clean and valid
* Responsive design - this means the template will adjust and look great as well as being usable on devices other than desktop computers (ex: smartphones, tablets, and large displays).


Goal
-----------

My main goal with this project is to keep up-to-date with the latest releases of both twitter-bootstrap and WHMCS.
